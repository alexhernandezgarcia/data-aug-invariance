# Data augmentation and invariance training

This repository contains part of the code of research projects developed by [Alex Hernandez-Garcia](https://alexhernandezgarcia.github.io/), focused on comparing the impact of [data augmentation and explicit regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03852) in deep neural networks trained for image object categorisation, as well as the implementation of perceptually and biologically inspired methods, such as [data augmentation invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04547).

Please note that the current version has not been tested with the most up to date version of the libraries. In particular, the functionality has been tested with Python 2.7 (although it is highly likely to work with Python 3), Keras 2.1.2 and TensorFlow 1.3.0. I am currently working on ensuring that the scripts run also with Python 3, as well as upgrading the functionality to Keras 2.3 and TensorFlow 2.
